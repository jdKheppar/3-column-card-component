## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS Media Queries

### What I learned

I have used three media queries for three different screen sizes and

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
element {
  border-top-left-radius: 10px;
  border-bottom-left-radius: 10px;
}
```

I also used google fonts.

### Continued development

I want to learn some other ways to center the main content and
apply other styles accordingly.
I have plans to add a new media query regarding mobile landscape viewport
